# Project Name: The New York Times - Article Page

## Week 1 Collaborative Project

Coding is an amazing experience & the more time I spent with the code I found myself addicted to not leaving it incomplete.

I was not at all confident about the linters, that was a first-time experience and I successfully managed to clear all errors.

Skills Revived & Learned:

- Versioning & best practices of maintaining branches of safe deployed and local dev
- git flow & Github flow
- HTML, CSS new and better elements, semantics, features etc
- Cloning - the hard work and skills needed to successfully make a clone.
- Linter - install & fix tests {still not managed to get styleint to run on VSC locally}
- Collaborative learning, being patient, helping each other succeed.
- Attending Daily standup, being focused, accountable.

> Learning Goals:

- Version Control & CSS
- Introduction to HTML & CSS concepts.
- Position, Flex, Floats
- Embeds and image manipulating
